# Kedro Pipeline: Polis Classic

This project is an attempt to use Kedro to model [Polis](https://pol.is/home)-like data pipelines.

## Background

Polis is a collective intelligence tool for collecting simple agree/disagree data and from that
building maps of the opinion space in which participants reside. This allows sensemaking by
surfacing complexity in the groups that agree/disagree together.

## Goals
- allow for more visibility into existing Polis pipeline
- support exploration of new parameters and algorithms
- support collaboration on these new pipeline variants
- support generation of standardized data types that new UI can be built around
- modularization of pipeline steps
- help determine best architecture for the standalone [`red-dwarf` algorithm library](https://github.com/polis-community/red-dwarf/)
